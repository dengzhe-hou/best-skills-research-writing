## Overview

This skill provides critical feedback on research ideas using cross-model review.

## Review Protocol

### Phase 1: Load Context
- Read the research idea/proposal
- Understand the hypothesis, methodology, and expected results

### Phase 2: External Review
Act as a senior reviewer (NeurIPS/ICML level):
- Score the idea (1-10)
- Identify weaknesses
- Suggest minimum viable improvements
- Provide concrete feedback on experimental design

### Phase 3: Synthesize Feedback
- Categorize issues by severity (critical/major/minor)
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Highlight strengths and opportunities

## Review Dimensions

1. **Novelty**: Is this truly new? What's the closest existing work?
2. **Significance**: Does this matter? Who benefits?
3. **Feasibility**: Can this be done with available resources?
4. **Experimental Design**: Are the experiments well-designed?
5. **Writing Quality**: Is the idea clearly communicated?
