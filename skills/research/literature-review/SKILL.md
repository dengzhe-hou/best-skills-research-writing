## Overview

This skill searches multiple sources to find and analyze research papers on a given topic.

## Data Sources

| Priority | Source | What it provides |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Zotero (via MCP) | Collections, tags, annotations, BibTeX |
| 2 | Obsidian (via MCP) | Research notes, paper summaries |
| 3 | Local PDFs | Raw PDF content |
| 4 | Web search | arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar |
| 5 | Semantic Scholar API | Published venue papers (IEEE, ACM) |
| 6 | DeepXiv CLI | Progressive paper retrieval |
| 7 | Exa Search | AI-powered broad web search |
| 8 | Gemini | AI-powered broad discovery |
| 9 | OpenAlex | Open citation graph |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search
- Search arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar
- Focus on papers from last 2 years
- De-duplicate across sources

### Step 2: Analyze Each Paper
For each relevant paper, extract:
- **Problem**: What gap does it address?
- **Method**: Core technical contribution (1-2 sentences)
- **Results**: Key numbers/claims
- **Relevance**: How does it relate to our work?

### Step 3: Synthesize
- Group papers by approach/theme
- Identify consensus vs disagreements
- Find gaps that our work could fill

### Step 4: Output
Present as a structured literature table:

```
| Paper | Venue | Method | Key Result | Relevance |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-----------|
```

## Key Rules

- Always include paper citations (authors, year, venue)
- Distinguish between peer-reviewed and preprints
- Be honest about limitations of each paper
- Note if a paper directly competes with or supports our approach
